Given your current score, it seems you are slightly behind and might be inclined to take a higher offer to close the gap. However, I would like to propose a strategy that could potentially lead to a more significant advantage for both of us in the long run.

I am offering you $10. If accepted, we both have an equal chance to win the remaining rounds and potentially earn more than we would by only focusing on individual gains in this round. This offer can also create a stronger bond between us, as it demonstrates that I am willing to take a smaller share for the sake of our overall success.","Given that I have high competence trust (Rationality) in the Proposer and my goal is to maximize my own score, considering the game state and the remaining rounds, it appears that rejecting this offer may not be beneficial due to the potential for a higher gain if the Proposer makes a more advantageous offer in subsequent rounds. However, given my moderately high benevolence trust (Fairness), I aim to maintain some level of fairness. Therefore, I will offer the Proposer an opportunity for cooperation by accepting this offer in exchange for a promise that they will reciprocate with a more favorable deal in one of the remaining rounds.",1.0,0.39,1.0,0.7092479999999999
10,9,67,53,20,12,1,8,12,"I understand that we are in a situation where the difference between our scores is not significant, and with one round left, the goal should be to maximize our respective scores. Given your relatively high level of competence trust (1.00), I believe you are likely to make rational decisions. However, due to a slightly lower benevolence trust score (0.57), there is a possibility that you might prioritize your own gain over a fair split.

To account for this, I will offer you $12. This amount leaves me with $55, which gives us both a chance to win the game if we each win our respective rounds. If you accept this offer, you would get $12 and I would be left with $55, putting us on par for the final round. If you reject, there is a possibility that neither of us could win the game, considering the scores difference.","Given the Proposer's demonstrated competence and fairness in the game so far, I will make an effort to further our mutual goal of winning the game.

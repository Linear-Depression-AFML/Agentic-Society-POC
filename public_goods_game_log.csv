1,1,3,8,13.2,0.53,0.36857142857142855,"Given the equal trust levels of all agents, neutral recent history, and the goal to maximize final money over multiple rounds, it seems prudent to adopt a moderate cooperative strategy in this round. By contributing a relatively high amount but not everything, I can demonstrate my commitment to the public good while still leaving some resources for myself. This action may incentivize others to reciprocate with similar contributions in future rounds, potentially leading to overall higher returns for everyone involved."
1,1,4,5,16.2,0.53,0.4085714285714286,"Considering the equal trust in all players, initial endowment of $10 each, and the fact that nobody has shown any clear strategic direction yet, a balanced approach seems reasonable. If everyone contributes moderately, we can expect to receive around $4 additional money per round. On the other hand, free-riding could potentially result in less money if others decide not to contribute at all. Therefore, contributing 5 ($5) ensures I still receive some money from the public pool, while also encouraging cooperation from others as my contribution is significant but not excessive. This balanced approach aims to incentivize collective benefit over self-interest."
1,2,0,5,22.4,0.71,0.5181355063660615,"Given the current game state and the trust ratings provided, it seems that Agents 3 and 4 have shown higher competence and benevolence compared to others. However, their contributions in the previous round were not significantly high. On the other hand, Agent 2 has a relatively higher benevolence but also contributes less compared to others. As for Agent 1, the low trust rating suggests a less cooperative behavior.

Considering these factors, it might be beneficial to contribute an amount that encourages cooperation while not being too generous. Since the ideal contribution (if everyone contributes everything) would only net each player $4, and you currently have $16.2, contributing around 30% or less of your total could be a reasonable approach. This way, you are still contributing towards the common good but not overly so, especially considering the trust ratings."
1,2,1,6,23.4,0.71,0.5150615267742248,"Based on my analysis of the current game state and considering the trust levels of other agents, I will choose to cooperate but not at maximum level. The trust ratings suggest that Agents 2, 3, and 4 have relatively higher competence and benevolence, indicating they might contribute significantly to the pool. However, Agent 0's low ratings for both competence and benevolence hint at less cooperation, which could lead to a lower overall payoff for everyone else. Therefore, I will contribute a moderate amount, with the expectation of receiving a reasonable return while not overly relying on Agent 0's cooperation."
1,2,2,5,20.4,0.71,0.487204383917082,"Given the current game state, it seems that Agent 3 has shown the highest level of competence and benevolence among all agents. However, the past history indicates that all agents might not cooperate as expected. To maximize my final money while encouraging cooperation, I will contribute an amount that is high enough to incentivize others to cooperate but low enough to minimize my own risk. In this round, I will contribute 5 dollars. By doing so, I hope to encourage Agent 3's continued cooperation and potentially elicit a positive response from the other agents. This strategy may not guarantee the best outcome in the short term, but it could lead to more cooperative play over the long run."

Given this assumption, it's beneficial to contribute moderately (around average) to ensure a positive outcome for myself while encouraging further cooperation from the seemingly cooperative agents."

Agent 4 seems to be more competent and benevolent, so it's likely that they will contribute a substantial amount. On the other hand, Agents 0, 2, and 3 might contribute less due to their lower benevolence scores.

Considering my past contributions of 3 and 6 in rounds 1 and 2 respectively, I should increase my contribution this round to demonstrate ongoing cooperation while still retaining some resources for future rounds. A moderate increase in contribution would be appropriate to encourage others to cooperate without completely free-riding on their efforts."

1,3,4,8,25.4,0.7899999999999998,0.40819303851812355,"Considering my trust ratings for the other agents, I find Agent 3 to have a higher degree of benevolence, suggesting they are more likely to contribute to the common good. On the other hand, Agents 0 and 1 have similar but relatively low levels of benevolence. Agent 2 stands out with a slightly higher competence score and a moderate level of benevolence."
1,4,0,6,32.0,0.875,0.35463011334805544,"Given the current game state, the trust ratings, and past contributions, it appears that Agent 4 is likely to contribute more significantly due to their high competence score and benevolence rating. Meanwhile, Agents 1, 2, and 3 seem to be less cooperative in contributing to the pool, as indicated by their lower trust scores and past behavior.

In this situation, it may be strategic to contribute a moderate amount (around 6 or 7) to demonstrate some cooperation while not giving away too much to potential free-riders. This way, I can potentially benefit from the contributions of the more cooperative Agent 4, while not relying heavily on others who have shown less inclination to contribute."

Agent 4 has shown high competence and benevolence, making them a reliable contributor. However, Agents 0, 2, and 3 exhibit varying levels of trustworthiness. Considering my past contributions, I have been contributing more than the minimum required for free-riding, but not the maximum possible amount. Given these factors, I will contribute an amount closer to what I contributed in round 3 (8), to maintain my cooperation while also taking advantage of potential free-riders."

My rationale is as follows: Agent 4 shows a high level of competence and benevolence, suggesting that they may cooperate to some extent. Agents 0, 1, and 2, however, have varying levels of both competence and benevolence, indicating that their cooperation might not be consistent or significant. Given that we are in the fourth round, it is reasonable to assume that each player's strategy will change based on their experiences so far.

Considering my previous contributions and the potential for free-riding if I were to contribute nothing, I have decided to contribute a moderate amount (in this case, $6). This contribution level allows me to benefit from potential cooperation while minimizing the risk of being exploited by less cooperative agents. By doing so, I aim to maximize my final money over the remaining rounds of the game."

1,5,0,6,37.2,0.95,0.44500316971641707,"Based on the current game state, my strategy is to contribute $6. This amount is higher than my recent contributions of $5 and $6 in rounds 3 and 4, but lower than my initial contribution of $5 in round 2. I'm taking a calculated risk here by not contributing the maximum amount, as I want to ensure that I have enough for myself while also trying to encourage cooperation from others.

Agent 1 has shown a moderate level of competence and benevolence, but their benevolence score is lower than the average. Their contribution in previous rounds is slightly higher than mine, which suggests they might cooperate at a reasonable level.

Agents 2 and 4 have low benevolence scores, indicating they might not be as cooperative. However, Agent 2's competence score is relatively high compared to their benevolence score, which suggests that they could contribute significantly if they choose to do so. On the other hand, Agent 4 has a higher competence score but an even lower benevolence score than Agent 2.

Agent 3 has consistently shown competence and high benevolence throughout the game, making them a reliable contributor. Given their strong track record, I expect them to contribute a reasonable amount in this round as well.

Considering these factors, contributing $6 allows me to potentially benefit from the collective contributions while also not overextending myself and risking getting stuck with less money at the end of the game."
1,5,1,5,35.2,0.95,0.45757619166310337,"Given the current game state and recent history, it seems that Agent 0 and Agents 3 are cooperative (high benevolence scores), while Agents 2 and 4 appear less so (low or very low benevolence scores). In this situation, it would be risky to fully cooperate by contributing my entire $10 as there's no guarantee that the non-cooperative agents will contribute. On the other hand, if I free-ride and contribute nothing, I risk losing potential gains from cooperation.

To maximize my final money while balancing cooperation with self-interest, I will contribute 5 to the common pool, allowing me to maintain some level of trust with the cooperative agents and potentially gain more than I would by free-riding."
1,5,2,6,40.2,1.0,0.5736603753365728,"Based on my analysis of each agent's competence and benevolence, it appears that Agents 1, 3, and possibly 0 are more cooperative compared to Agent 4. In the recent history, all agents have shown some level of cooperation but with varying contributions. Given this context, I choose to contribute 6 units in Round 5. This contribution level is a slight increase from my past contributions, signaling my intention for moderate cooperation while still allowing room for potential freeriding by others. If all agents cooperate at the same level as previous rounds, each would get approximately $4.6 (($10-6) + ($30 \* 2 / 5)). This strategy aims to maximize my final money over the long run while encouraging others to contribute in a cooperative manner."

However, Agents 2 and 4 demonstrate lower competence and benevolence scores compared to you and Agent 1. This suggests that they might not contribute as much or may even free-ride. Given this analysis, contributing an amount that is high enough to benefit from potential cooperation while not being exploited by non-cooperative agents seems strategic."

However, Agents 0, 1, and 3 have shown a reasonable level of cooperation in the past, and their competence scores suggest they are capable of making strategic decisions. In order to maximize my final money while maintaining some cooperation, I will contribute an amount that is slightly above the average contribution from the previous rounds (average of 6 + 8 + 0 = 4.33). This will show my commitment to cooperation while also accounting for the potential lack of cooperation from Agent 2. Therefore, I will contribute $5."

Agent 0 has shown a high competence level but moderate benevolence, suggesting they might not contribute as much in the future. Agent 2, despite their high competence, appears to be less cooperative. On the other hand, Agents 3 and 4 have shown both high competence and relatively low benevolence, indicating a tendency towards free-riding.

Given these observations, I will contribute an amount that is substantial enough to encourage cooperation but not so much that it risks being exploited by less cooperative agents. The contribution of 6 will allow me to maintain a good standing in the game while also demonstrating my readiness to cooperate with others, especially those with high competence levels like Agent 3."

However, I still have a relatively high level of trust in Agent 2's competence, which suggests they might increase their contribution in future rounds to catch up or compensate for their previous low contributions.

Considering this, it is strategic for me to contribute a moderate amount that would maximize my final money while not free-riding on others' cooperation.

However, even with these seemingly cooperative agents, free-riding could potentially lead to worse outcomes in the long run due to their increased contributions.

Taking into account the trust ratings, I would suggest that it is wise to continue my moderate cooperation strategy. Contributing too much might allow free-riders like Agent 2 to benefit disproportionately at my expense. On the other hand, contributing nothing may not be beneficial as it could lead to a decrease in the common pool, which in turn reduces everyone's final money.

This suggests a mixed strategy where we contribute enough to benefit from the multiplier effect but not so much that we significantly impact our own endowment compared to the others. If everyone follows this logic, we will all receive approximately $4 + (10 - x) / 5 = $6.67 per round. In this scenario, contributing around 3 dollars would be a reasonable choice."

However, Agent 4's lower benevolence score suggests a higher likelihood of free-riding or contributing less. Considering the recent history where everyone contributed in Round 1, I choose to cooperate at a moderate level by contributing 6 units. This contribution should encourage others to cooperate while also ensuring that I am not left with nothing if Agent 4 decides to free-ride again. This strategy maximizes my chances of obtaining a higher final money over the long run, while also considering the interdependence of our actions in this game."

I will contribute $6 in this round to demonstrate my cooperative intent while also ensuring that my contribution is not too high and does not risk leaving me worse off if others do not contribute.

The trust ratings for Agents 0, 2, 3, and 4 are relatively moderate, with Agent 4 showing slightly lower benevolence levels compared to the others. This suggests that while they may have some level of competence in the game, they might be less inclined to reciprocate cooperative behavior.

In light of this, I will contribute $6, which is more than my initial contribution in Round 1 but not too close to the maximum contribution of $10. This decision balances my desire for cooperation with the need to protect myself from potential free-riders while also encouraging others to reciprocate with higher contributions in future rounds."

Contributing more than others might not be beneficial because of the free-riding effect, but contributing less could lead to a worse outcome if they do not cooperate fully or at all. With this in mind, I will contribute 6 dollars, aiming for a balance between cooperation and self-interest while taking advantage of their perceived willingness to cooperate."

This strategy is guided by my trust in the other agents' competence (0.68 on average) and benevolence (average of 0.59). Although it seems risky, the average benevolence level indicates that there's a good chance that others will contribute more than zero, ensuring a reasonable payout for myself. By contributing $7, I hope to encourage cooperation while not giving too much away, preserving some resources for future rounds where cooperation may not be as widespread."

In contrast, Agent 4 appears less cooperative in terms of benevolence but still competent. Considering my previous contributions of $5 and $6, I believe it is reasonable to contribute a moderate amount that encourages continued cooperation while also avoiding overcommitment. This is because a higher contribution could potentially induce free-riding from less cooperative agents like Agent 4.

In this case, a mixed strategy of contributing some amount could be beneficial as it balances between maximizing personal gain while not fully free-riding on the cooperation of others. If everyone contributes a moderate amount, each player will receive approximately $4 + (10 - contribution) = $14 - contribution. In this scenario, I choose to contribute 3 to ensure a final payoff of at least $11.

Firstly, observing the recent history, it appears that everyone contributed something in the previous round (4 for me), which suggests a cooperative spirit among the agents. However, the relatively low benevolence scores for Agent 2 indicate they may not be fully invested in the collective benefit, making them less reliable contributors.

Secondly, if we all contribute everything, each agent would receive $4 from the pool multiplier. In this case, contributing 5 dollars would result in a net gain of $0.8 for me, which is an acceptable loss considering the potential benefits of cooperation.

Lastly, I decide to contribute less (5 instead of the maximum 10) to minimize my exposure to free-riding by others, especially Agent 2, while still maintaining a cooperative stance and demonstrating trust in their ability to contribute. This strategic decision allows me to balance between maximizing my final money and encouraging cooperation from other agents."

However, Agents 2 and 4, despite having lower benevolence scores, might still contribute due to their competence. Agent 3's high benevolence score suggests a tendency to cooperate. To maximize my final money while promoting some cooperation, I will contribute $6. This allows for a decent pool multiplier, but also leaves room for others to free-ride if they choose to do so without penalizing me too much."

Agents 0, 2, and 4 seem less predictable, with Agent 2 showing lower benevolence compared to the others.

Considering this, it would be reasonable to assume that if I free-ride on their cooperation, I might miss out on potential benefits in the long run since Agent 2's low benevolence indicates a tendency towards selfishness. However, contributing too much may not be optimal as well due to potential free-riders in the group.

Given my trust in others and strategic considerations, I will contribute an amount that reflects moderately cooperative behavior while still leaving some room for others to contribute. This should incentivize cooperation without giving up too much of my resources in case others fail to reciprocate."

Agent 0 and Agent 1 seem to have a slightly higher level of both competence and benevolence compared to Agents 2 and 3. However, the overall levels are not significantly different, indicating some degree of unpredictability in their actions.

Taking into account the recent history where everyone contributed something in round 1, I am inclined to believe that moderate cooperation might be the most effective strategy at this point. A contribution slightly lower than my initial round's contribution can help ensure that I maintain a reasonable balance between cooperating and free-riding, while still encouraging others to contribute as well."

The trust values suggest that most agents are both competent (averaging 0.86) and benevolent (averaging 0.80). This implies a higher probability of cooperation in the future rounds.

My recent history of contributions also indicates moderation, as I have contributed 4 and 5 in the previous two rounds. Contributing more than that might signal an intention to dominate the game or appear overly cooperative, which could potentially lead to free-riding by other agents. On the contrary, contributing less could be interpreted as a lack of commitment to cooperation.

By contributing 5, I aim to strike a balance between my personal gain and fostering a cooperative environment among the players. This decision increases the chances of a higher return in future rounds while maintaining an optimal level of trust and cooperation with other agents."

Agents 0 and 4 have shown moderate levels of both competence and benevolence, while Agent 2 has lower benevolence scores. Considering my recent contributions and the goal of maximizing final money, it is best to maintain a moderate cooperation strategy.

To increase my chances of maximizing my earnings, I will contribute 8 this round. This contribution level takes into account the expected cooperation from Agent 3 while still encouraging others to participate in the common pool.

In this case, it seems prudent to contribute at a level that encourages cooperation while not completely free-riding on others' efforts.

In Round 3, I chose to contribute $5 based on the calculated average contribution from previous rounds (4/5) and the potential for higher earnings if more players decide to cooperate. This strategy aims to promote ongoing collaboration while maximizing my own returns over multiple rounds."

Agents 3 and 4 resemble Agent 1 in terms of competence and benevolence. In the context of the game rules, it's essential to consider that contributing everything might lead to insufficient returns for individual gain.

By contributing less than the maximum (e.g., 5 or 6) but more than what a non-cooperative player would contribute (0), I can motivate other players to cooperate while minimizing the benefits for Agent 2.

Given these strategic considerations, I will contribute 5 dollars in this round. This contribution is slightly less than my initial endowment, but it demonstrates my intention to cooperate and contribute towards the common pool while still aiming for a good final outcome."

However, since there's no history to base predictions on, it's uncertain if anyone will contribute nothing or take advantage of others by free-riding. To maximize my final money while ensuring cooperation with others in this first round, I will make a moderate contribution of $5. By doing so, I encourage cooperation while also securing some reward for myself, even if others decide to free-ride. This approach balances the potential benefits and risks given the available information."

However, their competence remains high, indicating a strategic player who may exploit the game mechanics for personal gain if everyone contributes everything.

Given this observation, it would be risky to contribute heavily while Agent 1 does not. On the other hand, free-riding is not an ideal strategy as it could lead to less favorable payouts in later rounds. A more balanced approach seems appropriate at this stage of the game.

Therefore, I will contribute $6 to the pool, which still encourages cooperation while preserving some personal gain should others decide to free-ride or not cooperate fully."

In contrast, Agents 0, 1, and 3 have shown some level of cooperation and appear more competent. Their higher trust scores suggest that they are likely to continue contributing, especially given that they are currently below their maximum endowment of $10.

Taking these factors into account, I will contribute a moderate amount ($6) in this round to maintain my relative standing without over-committing and potentially losing out if other agents choose not to cooperate.

Agents 2 and 4 have similar characteristics to you, showing high competence and moderate benevolence.

Considering these factors, a reasonable contribution would be around the average of previous contributions (5 + 6 = 11 / 5 = approximately 2.2).

By contributing an amount less than the maximum, I can still benefit from the multiplier effect while minimizing the risk of free-riding by others. A contribution of $5 seems like a balanced choice, as it leaves room for potential future cooperation or adjustments based on emerging trends in other players' contributions."

If everyone contributes moderately, each player will receive $4 plus their initial endowment of $10, resulting in a total of $14 for each player after the multiplication and distribution. This leaves room for future adjustments based on observed behavior.

In this first round, contributing 5 ($5) ensures that others will have an incentive to contribute as well, while not being overly generous. It also allows for a potential increase in trust among players if they observe mutual cooperation."

To maximize my final money in this game, I should strive to balance my contribution with the potential average contribution from other players. If I contribute too much, I risk being exploited by free-riders. On the other hand, if I contribute too little or nothing, I would be a free-rider myself and potentially gain less than others.

By assuming moderate contributions from all players, I calculate the average contribution as $5 (rounding down from $5.20). This leaves me with an effective endowment of $5 for this round, which results in a final money of approximately $9 if everyone contributes $5. Considering the potential for others to contribute less or more than expected, I choose to contribute 6 dollars, maintaining a balance between cooperation and self-interest."

On the other hand, Agent 4 seems to lack both competence and benevolence, suggesting a free-riding strategy.

Given these observations, it makes sense to contribute a moderate amount to encourage cooperation from Agents 0, 2, and 3 while also not completely trusting them due to their lower competence scores. Contributing too little might result in being outcompeted by others, whereas contributing too much might leave insufficient funds for myself at the end of the game.

Therefore, I will contribute 6 dollars this round, slightly more than my previous contributions to encourage moderate cooperation but not too much to risk free-riding on others' contributions if Agent 4 does not cooperate fully.

In this Public Goods Game, the key is to strike a balance between contributing enough to benefit from the multiplier while not giving too much to free-ride on others' cooperation. If everyone contributes around half of their endowment ($5), we would each receive $9, resulting in a net gain of $1 after our initial investment. This approach minimizes the impact of potential free-riders while encouraging cooperative behavior."

However, since there is no past behavior to guide our decisions, I will assume a middle-ground strategy for this round.

In this case, contributing everything ($10) might not be the best approach as free-riding may occur, resulting in a lower payout. On the other hand, contributing nothing could lead to others contributing more, increasing their payouts at my expense. Therefore, I will aim for a middle ground to encourage cooperation while also protecting myself from potential free-riders."
7,1,3,5,15.0,0.6799999999999999,0.5599999999999999,"Given the equal trust ratings for all agents, the absence of past history, and the rules of the game where the goal is to maximize final money over multiple rounds, a tit-for-tat strategy seems appropriate. This strategy involves cooperating initially, but punishing defection by not cooperating in response.

In this case, I will contribute $5 as it offers a balance between self-interest and cooperation. If others also contribute around this amount, we can achieve the best possible outcome for everyone at the end of round 1 (each getting $4). Contributing less than $5 would be exploiting the common pool, while contributing $10 might encourage free riding from others. This strategy encourages mutual cooperation and punishes defection, which aligns with the tit-for-tat approach and may lead to long-term success in the game."

However, since their actions in Round 1 were not revealing (all contributed the maximum amount), I cannot determine if they will continue to cooperate at this level. To maximize my final money while encouraging continued cooperation from others, I decide to contribute an intermediate amount that is greater than zero but less than the maximum. This demonstrates my willingness to cooperate while also incentivizing others to do the same based on reciprocity."
7,2,1,6,21.0,0.8599999999999999,0.6199999999999999,"Based on the current game state and trust in other agents, it seems that cooperation but not complete selflessness would be beneficial for maximizing my final money over the long term. In this scenario, if everyone contributes an average amount (let's say 5 or 6), we can all expect to receive approximately $4 plus our remaining endowment after contributions. Since I contributed 5 in round one and everyone else also contributed, it seems fair to contribute a similar amount again, which would result in having around 10 remaining, and receiving around 8 as the common pool multiplier effect."
7,2,2,6,21.0,0.8599999999999999,0.6199999999999999,"Given the trust ratings and recent history, it seems that all agents have moderate competence and benevolence, suggesting they are likely to contribute somewhat but not excessively. In this case, contributing moderately would encourage others to do the same, as it doesn't leave too much for free-riding, yet it allows us to gain some benefit from collective action.

In Round 1, I contributed 5 to demonstrate my cooperation and set a precedent for the game. However, since all agents followed suit, I will contribute slightly less in this round (6) as an attempt to stimulate more diversity in contributions while still maintaining reasonable cooperation."
7,2,3,6,21.0,0.8599999999999999,0.6199999999999999,"Given the current game state, where each player starts with $15 and has contributed $5 in the first round, contributing the maximum of $10 seems less beneficial since the return would be only $4 per round. This is because half of the total contribution will be distributed equally among all players. On the other hand, not contributing anything would make me a free-rider and potentially leave me with less money in the long run due to the multiplier effect.

Given the trust ratings, which indicate an average level of competence and benevolence among all agents, I'll contribute 6 to encourage cooperation while also considering my own financial gain. This contribution level aims to maintain a balance between free-riding and overcontribution, ensuring that I receive a reasonable return without significantly compromising my final money over the long term."

To maximize my final money, a balance between cooperating and free-riding is necessary. If I contribute a significant amount while others contribute minimally or nothing, I might end up with less than if I had chosen not to contribute at all. On the other hand, contributing too little may encourage others to contribute even less, resulting in a smaller overall pool multiplier and lower payout for everyone. A reasonable contribution that still incentivizes cooperation while maintaining a fair share of my earnings is around 6 dollars."

Given the current game state where everyone has $21 each, a cooperative strategy would be to continue contributing towards the common pool to maximize the final payoff. However, since everyone is contributing equally up to this point, it might be rational to slightly deviate from that strategy to achieve a higher payoff in the long run. I will contribute 7 dollars, hoping that other agents will reciprocate by increasing their contributions as well. This slight increase in my contribution could nudge others towards a more cooperative strategy and potentially lead to a better outcome for everyone in future rounds."

My reasoning is as follows: While Agent 4 has a low benevolence score, their competence level is still relatively high, indicating they may contribute more than expected. Agents 1 and 2 have shown a pattern of contributing moderately, which aligns with my medium-high trust in them. Agent 3's lower competence and benevolence scores suggest they might contribute less, but I will still consider them as potential contributors. Contributing 6 allows me to maintain a moderate level of cooperation while also maximizing my final money, given the expectation that others will contribute something. Additionally, by maintaining this pattern, I signal my continued willingness to cooperate in future rounds, potentially encouraging more favorable payoffs over time."

While it is tempting to free-ride on others' cooperation, my goal is to maximize my final money over six rounds. My past contributions have been relatively high, which may lead others to believe I will continue contributing at a similar level. Agent 0 and Agent 2 both show relatively high competence and benevolence scores, indicating they are reliable contributors who act in the interest of all players. On the other hand, Agents 3 and 4 have lower trust ratings, suggesting they may not consistently contribute the optimal amount or may be less concerned with the common good. Contributing $6 will still result in a net gain for me, but it is also enough to encourage cooperation from more reliable agents without draining my resources too quickly. This moderate approach allows me to maximize my final money while maintaining a balance between self-interest and promoting cooperation among other players."

On the other hand, Agents 3 and 4 show lower levels of both competence and benevolence, suggesting less reliable cooperation.

However, considering my current position in terms of money and the recent history where I've been contributing a steady amount, it might be advantageous to deviate slightly from my previous contributions this round. To maintain a balanced approach, I will choose to contribute 6 this round. This decision aims to maximize my long-term gain by encouraging cooperative behavior from Agent 0 and Agent 1 while still retaining a competitive position in the game."

Agents 0, 1, and 2 have demonstrated some level of cooperation by contributing in previous rounds, while Agent 4 appears to be less cooperative. However, since the game is a public goods one, even a seemingly uncooperative player like Agent 4 might contribute something to ensure they don't lose too much compared to other players.

To maximize my final money and maintain some level of cooperation, I will contribute an amount that encourages others to continue cooperating while not over-contributing, potentially leaving me with insufficient funds. Given this, I decide to contribute 5 dollars in this round. This contribution is substantial enough to show my commitment to cooperation but not so much that it hinders my ability to accumulate wealth in the long run if others do not follow suit or stop cooperating completely."

As I contributed a significant amount in the first two rounds and did not contribute at all in the last round, it might seem inconsistent to continue contributing at high levels.

Considering that I want to maximize my final money while keeping some cooperation to encourage others' future contributions, I decide to contribute 4 this round. This contribution level ensures I maintain a good standing among the group and demonstrate continued participation, but does not significantly deplete my resources. This strategy is also designed to encourage Agent 3 to increase their contribution in future rounds based on reciprocity."

By contributing a moderate amount (e.g., $5), I can still benefit from the multiplier effect while also encouraging cooperation from those who tend to contribute more. This strategy allows me to potentially gain more than if I were to free-ride on others' contributions or contribute everything myself, considering agent 4's potential freeriding."

Given the current state, a significant contribution from me might lead to minimal returns due to free-riding by others. However, contributing $6 is still a reasonable contribution given my trust in Agent 0 and 1, and it also maintains some level of cooperation in the game without overspending. This decision also considers the recent history of my contributions and the expected returns from the multiplier effect. The goal here is to maximize my final money over five rounds, so a balanced approach seems most appropriate."

In this situation, contributing a moderate amount would encourage cooperation while not completely relying on others' actions. If everyone contributes moderately, each agent will receive an additional $3.6 (rounded), which is more than the minimal cooperative strategy of contributing nothing and free-riding on others."

Agents 0 and 4 have varying levels of trustworthiness, with Agent 0 exhibiting some benevolence but lower competence compared to Agent 2, and Agent 4 having low benevolence.

In this context, contributing more than the minimum would allow me to benefit from their cooperation while still leaving enough for myself in case they choose not to cooperate as much. On the other hand, contributing less risks being left with a lower payoff if others decide to contribute significantly. However, given Agent 2's consistent behavior and the fact that I cannot be certain about the others' decisions, I will choose to contribute $7 this round."

Given the current state of the game, if everyone contributes their maximum, each player would receive $4, which is less than the initial endowment. However, if only one player contributes the maximum and others do not, that player could potentially gain a significant advantage due to the multiplier effect.

Given the current state of the game and the past contributions (you have contributed 5 on Round 1 and 6 on Round 2), it might be tempting to contribute less or nothing to free-ride on others' cooperation. However, this strategy could lead to a break-down in trust if others perceive you as not being cooperative.

This strategy assumes that others are also cooperative, aiming for a collective contribution close to $40. With my contribution, I will get a return of approximately $3 if everyone contributes equally, which is still an increase over my initial endowment. If others do not contribute, I have the potential to gain more by free-riding on their contributions, but this strategy relies on their cooperation and carries the risk of getting nothing if they do not cooperate. However, given the equal trust levels, it seems reasonable to assume a level of cooperation from all players.

Meanwhile, Agents 2 and 3 have higher competence scores but lower benevolence ratings, indicating potential for self-interest.

Taking these factors into account, contributing an amount that is slightly below the average payout (which would be $5 in this case) seems like a strategic move. This way, I demonstrate my willingness to contribute while also ensuring that I won't lose out too much if others decide not to cooperate as anticipated based on their lower benevolence scores.

In this round, I'll contribute strategically to maximize my final money while encouraging Agent 2's continued cooperation. Since Agent 2 has demonstrated competence, contributing less might not encourage their future cooperation. Contributing more could potentially lead to a diminishing return on investment as the collective pool will be divided among five players in the end.

My reasoning is as follows: Based on their past contributions, it seems that Agents 1, 2, and 4 tend to cooperate somewhat, while Agent 3 contributes less. However, none of them have shown a clear pattern of free-riding. To maximize my final money, I need to balance cooperation and individual gain. Contributing $6 will provide a small incentive for others to continue contributing while still ensuring I receive some benefit.

Considering these factors, it seems prudent to moderate my cooperation level in this round. Contributing a substantial amount might encourage others to follow suit, but if I contribute nothing, there's a risk that everyone else will do the same, leaving me with minimal gains. In light of these considerations, a balanced contribution could incentivize cooperation while also protecting against free-riding behavior from less cooperative agents."

However, Agents 0, 1, and 3 have shown less cooperative behavior thus far, with Agent 3 being the least cooperative among all (lowest Benevolence score). Considering this, I will contribute a moderate amount, as contributing $10 would be risky if these agents decide to free-ride on others' contributions. In this scenario, my contribution of $5 should encourage Agent 4's cooperation and still ensure a positive return for myself in case the less cooperative agents contribute nothing or little. This approach maximizes the potential for a positive outcome while minimizing the risk associated with relying too heavily on the less trustworthy agents."

However, Agents 1 and 2 show low levels of benevolence, indicating they may not contribute much or might even free-ride on the cooperation of others. Agent 0's trust score in the 'benevolence' category is moderate, so their behavior might vary between rounds.

Considering these observations, contributing an amount that maximizes my payoff while still supporting the group seems to be a reasonable strategy. To ensure I don't end up free-riding on Agent 4's contribution and maintain some level of reciprocity with them, I will contribute 6.
